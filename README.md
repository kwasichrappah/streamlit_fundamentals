# Customer Churn Prediction ML WebApp

## Overview
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. 


## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning webapp to allow the world to use our model.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical information about customers, including features such as:
- Customer demographics (age and gender)
- Services subscribed (phone and internet)
- Contract details (contract length and payment method)
- Usage patterns (monthly charges, total charges, tenure)
- Churn status (whether the customer churned or not)

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **src/**: Python files for the web pages.`
- **models/**: Saved machine learning tuned and non-tuned models.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone kwasichrappah/streamlit_fundamentals (github.com)

   cd streamlit_fundamentals
2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory for model deployment or further analysis.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Plotly



## Models
- Logistic Regression
- SVC 
- XGBoost
- CatBoost


## WebApp
WebApp was built using streamlit and authenthication also done using streamlit-authenthicator


## Deployment
Deployment was done using render.
